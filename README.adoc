= UniversalJSON

* This is a check plugin for checkmk with a ruleset.
* It aims to be a "better" ``<<<local>>>`` check.

== Advantages over local check

* Agent section data is structured JSON.
* The agent can decide if the state is OK, WARNING, CRITICAL, or UNKNOWN just like with local checks ...
* üçæ But you can configure service rules to override the state based on if threshold value are exceeded.
* In other words: If you have metrics, you can configure thresholds on the checkmk server.
* Unlike local checks it supports counters üçª !!!
* You can emit your own details and summary.

== How does this work?

=== Example: One service with details summary in OK state

.simple example
----
<<<universaljson:sep(0)>>>
{"services":{"service0":{"summary":"summary for service0","details":"details for service0, expected to be OK","state":0}}}
----

HINT: As common with checkmk, the JSON is expected to be on one line.

.human readable
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "services": {
    "service0": {
      "summary": "summary for service0",
      "details": "details for service0, expected to be OK",
      "state": 0
    }
  }
}
----

HINT
====
Here it's just pretty printed to make it easier to understand the structure of the JSON.
You can format your JSON to a single line with:
----
jq -c < file.json
jq --compact-output < file.json
----
====

=== Example: more complex JSON

.Explanation
* service4 genereates two float metrics *temp* and *humidity*.
* service5 generates a metric which is actually a *counter* because it's a string (using "quotes") and has a suffix of *c*, like it was common in nagios compatible checks.

== Demo agent output

* link:assets/universaljson.txt[universaljson.txt]
* e.g. put it in https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/spool_directory.html[spool directory]

== TODO

* introduce a timestamp field to the json data and allow to warn if json data is outdated
* smooth the metric measurements with "truncated mean" a.k.a. trimmed mean (from the recent 5 past measurments drop the higest and the lowest and average the remaining 3) to avoid false alerts.
* add type hints to python code
* An "universal http(s) agent data fetcher" is in the pipe and will play well together with this check
